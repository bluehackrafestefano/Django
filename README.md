# Django

With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. It's a free and open-source framework that's designed on top of Python and supports data-driven architecture. This Django project includes defining a data model and fields, querying the database, and using the framework's built-in URL handlers, views, and templates to structure the rest of the back end.
